Welcome to this readme.txt file. I hope you'll find all you need here.

1.Introduction
==============
Memory Game is a very relaxing game that you can play after a long day at work,
when you don't feel like shooting aliens or saving the world. It loads very fast,
it is very easy to play and so it will allow you to relax. Memory Game has a large
number of card (icon) themes you can play with: flags, cartoons, elements of nature...
You can select your difficulty and then beat your record!

2.How to play?
==============
You must make all the cards go. You do that by matching pairs. Click a card to turn it up.
If you match a pair, it disappears from the board. If you click un-paired cards,
they turn back down. The thing is that you must remember where all the cards are, in order
to beat the record.
